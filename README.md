# SuperBooth19ConcertPatch
This is a graphviz representation of the patch I designed to perform on Friday May 10 at SuperBooth 2019.

Watch me try and control it live on stage at SuperBooth 19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of4UcwjWCWc the first half is an amazing set by Bj√∏rn Svin on his setup (which is not documented here)
